The guitars grind like rusted gears, looping in hypnotic patterns that mirror the mental static of sleep deprivation. Percussion hits like a heartbeat on the edge—erratic, pulsing, and desperate to break free.

Vocals are raw and frayed, delivered with a haunted clarity that feels both intimate and unhinged. The lyrics read like a fever journal: fragmented memories, whispered regrets, and defiant declarations stitched into a sonic blackout. There’s a sense of time collapsing—verses blur into choruses, and the bridge feels like a breakdown caught on tape.

The mix is intentionally claustrophobic. Reverb smears the edges, distortion bleeds into silence, and every sound feels like it’s echoing off the walls of a sleepless mind. It’s not just a song—it’s a broadcast from the edge of consciousness.","","","","","false","","2","1","1","0","0","34","0","","false","","","","true","","690895db5eb40ff29b1e7dcd","2025-11-03T11:45:31.740000","2025-11-08T16:17:07.688000","69083db69ccd1df29c9359c9","knoedlerjosiahd@gmail.com","false"

The track opens like a ritual wound: slow, sludgy guitars dripping with reverb and rot, while the drums stagger like a body trying to stay upright. It’s gothic, industrial, and unrepentantly filthy—built for the kind of listener who finds beauty in corrosion.

Vocals are snarled and spectral, weaving between lust and loathing. The lyrics feel like cursed scripture: “You wore my blood like blush”, “Every kiss was a needle.” There’s no redemption here—just the slow unraveling of a toxic muse who weaponized desire and left nothing but bruises and overdraft fees.

The chorus hits like a relapse: melodic enough to haunt, jagged enough to scar. The bridge is pure collapse—distorted whispers, broken promises, and a bassline that sounds like it’s dragging a body through gravel.","","https://youtu.be/9Ox0UBsf320?si=dw5hFacmWovJk-dP","https://soundcloud.com/youngdeadenterprise/dye-hoar?si=bfef3ef1dc724a65b80b36bf0db2cc14&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing","","false","","0","0","0","0","0","44","0","2025-11-04 06:23:50.43+00","false","","","","true","","690895db5eb40ff29b1e7dcf","2025-11-03T11:45:31.740000","2025-11-08T05:39:11.639000","69083db69ccd1df29c9359c9","knoedlerjosiahd@gmail.com","false"
